# simulate-an-eco-system-containing-bears-and-fish
Write a Python class to simulate an ecosystem containing two types of creatures, bears and fish. The ecosystem consists of a river, which is modeled as a relatively large list.  Each element of the list should be a Bear object, a Fish object, or None. In each time  step, based on a random process, each animal either attempts to move into an adjacent  list location or stay where it is. If two animals of the same type are about to collide in  the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they create a new instance of that  type of animal, which is placed in a random empty (i.e., previously None) location in the  list. If a bear and a fish collide, however, then the fish dies (i.e., it disappears).
